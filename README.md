# Zomato_Data_Analysis
This project involves the analysis and visualization of restaurant data using various Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset includes information about different types of restaurants, their ratings, number of votes, approximate cost for two people, and whether the orders are made online or offline.

Project Objectives:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform in-depth analysis of restaurant data to uncover trends and patterns.
Data Visualization: Create insightful visualizations to help understand customer behavior, pricing, ratings, and service preferences.
Interactive and Informative Insights: Generate visualizations like count plots, line plots, histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps to assist stakeholders in making data-driven decisions.
Key Features:
Restaurant Type Distribution:

Visualizes the count of different restaurant types using a countplot, helping to understand the prevalence of specific restaurant types.
Votes by Restaurant Type:

A line plot showing the total votes received by different restaurant types, offering insights into customer engagement.
Rating Distribution:

A histogram displays how ratings are distributed among restaurants, highlighting the most and least common ratings.
Couple Order Cost:

Analyzes the distribution of approximate costs for two people at restaurants, providing insights into pricing trends.
Online Order vs. Rating:

A boxplot comparing the ratings of restaurants based on online and offline orders, revealing the impact of order methods on customer satisfaction.
Heatmap: Online Order vs. Restaurant Type:

A heatmap visualizing the relationship between restaurant types and online/offline orders, showing how different restaurant types adapt to order methods.
